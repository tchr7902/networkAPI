# networkAPI

## Description

This project was built by utilizing several different tools and technologies to create a cohesive Mongoose database that can be interacted with. I build this project in order to test and exercise my knowledge of MongoDB, routes, models, controllers, and overall the MVC paradigm. This project allows for a database that stores users, their thoughts, their friends, and other peoples' reactions to those thoughts. Using Insomnia, you are able to do GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE requests in order to manipulate the data stored in the MongoDB. This project took lots of time and troubleshooting, but it really helped solidify my knowledge of these new technologies we've been learning, as well as following MVC.

## Usage

Using Insomnia, as aforementioned, you can make different requests in order to change the data stored in the database.

## Credits

I used many different sources in order to assist me in creating this project. Some of them are the MongoDB docs, Stack Overflow, Khan Academy, MDN Docs, etc.

## Future Development

Adding a front end to this project would be awesome. Being able to quickly interact with data on a polished user interface would be the cherry on top.
